# Browser Monkey
## What it is

Browser Monkey is a DOM manipulation and assertion library. It helps you write framework agnostic browser tests that are reliable in the face of asynchronous behaviours like animations, AJAX and delayed rendering. It also helps you to write tests that exhibit the semantic meaning of the page, as opposed to a jumble of CSS selectors.

## Features

 - Automatically waits for commands and assertions.
 - Create rich DSLs for your page structure.
 - Framework agnostic: works with React, Angular, jQuery, [Hyperdom](https://github.com/featurist/hyperdom) and many many more.
 - Simulates text entry and clicks.
 - Promise based.
 - Typescript types.
