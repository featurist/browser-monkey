# Browser Monkey
## What it is

Browser Monkey is a DOM manipulation and assertion library. It helps you write framework agnostic browser tests that are reliable in the face of asynchronous behaviours like animations, AJAX and delayed rendering. It also helps you to write tests that exhibit the semantic meaning of the page, as opposed to a jumble of CSS selectors.

## Features

 - Automatically waits for elements to appear on the page.
 - Simulates text entry and clicks.
 - Rich DSLs for your page structure.
 - Promise based.
 - Framework agnostic.
 - Typescript types.
